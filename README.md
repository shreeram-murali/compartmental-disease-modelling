# Compartmental Disease Modelling

This repository is an ongoing project to implement different compartmental models which deal with modelling the spread of an infectious disease within a population. The most common model is known as the **SIR Model**, which divides the population into three compartments: Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered. Currently, the program contains the implementation of a simple SIR model and solves it as an ODE initial value problem. 

Next steps: This README.md will be updated shortly, and after satisfactory implementation of a few functions, the project will be expanded into an interactive Jupyter Notebook.
